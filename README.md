# OASIS Climate - Smart Thermostat Integration for Home Assistant

## 🚀 Coming Soon: The Next Generation of Home Climate Control

**OASIS Climate** is a high-performance Home Assistant integration designed to eliminate energy waste and maximize indoor comfort.

Unlike traditional thermostats that simply react to temperature swings, OASIS uses advanced predictive modeling to manage your heating and cooling systems **proactively**. We are transforming the conventional thermostat into a highly efficient, autonomous system that learns the unique thermal DNA of your home.

This repository is actively being developed. Our core technology creates a **Digital Twin** of your house — a precise mathematical clone used to run millions of what-if scenarios. This allows our algorithms to anticipate future weather conditions, exploit your home's thermal inertia, and plan the most energy-efficient actuation schedule possible. Our goal is to achieve an unparalleled level of *energy efficiency without sacrificing comfort*.

When fully released, the OASIS Climate integration will enable full **Autopilot Mode** for your boiler or heat pump, providing an estimated energy saving. Stay tuned for the first release candidate, where you will be able to connect your smart devices and start collecting the data needed to build your Digital Twin.

## 🌱 Join the Climate-Positive Beta

We are currently opening our closed **Beta** for a limited number of early adopters who share our vision for a **greener economy**.

**Your contribution is vital**: by allowing our system to learn from your home's unique data, you directly help us refine the predictive AI that **drastically cuts energy waste and lowers carbon emissions**.

This is more than a software test-it is your active role in a collective shift toward intelligent, **climate-positive living**.

Join us now and be the change that optimizes comfort and protects the environment
